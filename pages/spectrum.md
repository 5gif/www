## Spectrum, the backbone for Connectivity revolution with 5G

Many industries are looking at 5G as the backbone of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is a golden opportunity for communications service providers (CSPs) to create and capture new market spaces by driving innovation, efficiency, and growth across various industries. There is a huge opportunity for CSPs to address industrial connectivity needs with 3GPP-based cellular technologies. The opportunity encompasses a range of industries, including diverse segments with diverse needs, such as those in the manufacturing, mining, port, energy and utilities, automotive and transport, public safety, media and entertainment, healthcare, and education industries, among others.

A key factor influencing the uptake of wireless solutions is the question of how to handle spectrum for industrial purposes, since reliable connectivity demands licensed spectrum. Some countries provide spectrum dedicated for industrial use, whereas others do not. For many industries, service-level agreements (SLAs) will satisfy and regulate such needs for guaranteed network uptime and quality. 

Harmonizing the use of spectrum bands across geographies is essential to achieving mass-market conditions which in turn enables cost-efficient and competitive industrial devices. Many countries have already begun to assign spectrum for 5G wide-area cellular networks, and quick regulatory actions and decisions have proven to be highly positive for all ecosystem parties, benefiting service providers and device makers with the ability to make technology investments as well as consumers with the possibility for earlier enjoyment of new generations of technology. 

Regarding the locally licensed spectrum considered by administrations, these diverse allocations pose challenges to building a device ecosystem for industrial applications. Device chipsets need to be supported not only by an ecosystem of traditional mobile broadband (MBB) devices but also by an ecosystem that includes industrial devices of varying complexity on different spectrum bands. 

## Requirements on regulation principles for locally licensed spectrum

Regulators and policy makers have a different set of challenges. In countries that have decided (or are planning to decide) on locally licensed industry spectrum, regulators and policymakers must find an easyto- understand and cost-efficient model for its regulation. If implementing locally licensed spectrum for industry purposes, they must ensure that its utilization is efficient. Additionally, it is important to note that the way in which licensed spectrum is managed within countries also impacts the appeal of the 3GPP path. When licensed spectrum is offered locally with the objective of satisfying the needs of industries, a few basic requirements should be fulfilled as to how this is offered.

These requirements include that:
* Access to spectrum must be predictable over a long period of time to support uninterrupted operation and major investments in production processes and industrial facilities having a lifecycle of typically 15–20 years.
* Schemes awarding excessive first-mover advantages should be avoided so that industries or other players do not block spectrum through spectrum hoarding.
* Local spectrum not yet licensed to industries should be kept available to increase spectrum utilization efficiency for spectrum license holders (such as CSPs), though with a sufficient safety margin to ensure that existing local networks are not subject to interference.

It should be noted that radio network providers and device makers can potentially face challenges with developing solutions for unique frequency bands unless the availability of devices and an ecosystem are factored into the decision of dedicating frequencies for locally licensed spectrum.

## Spectrum Workgroup

The spectrum workgroup of the 5GIF focuses on deliberations aimed at the policy aspects to spectrum for industry applications in India. One of the objectives of this group is in addressing concerns regarding spectrum access for those industries that are early adopters of 3GPP cellular technologies for limited areas — in particular, industries such as manufacturing, mining, and ports as well as those with the opportunity to use cellular technologies in their operations but which have not seen wide adoption yet, such as the airport, oil and gas, warehousing, hospital, education, and construction industries.
