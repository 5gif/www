## Technology & Standards

5G is not only about handling existing systems more efficiently but also cater for new possibilities and use cases many of which are yet not known. It is envisaged that 5G will be catering for the scalability and adaptability across extreme variations in consumer requirements. New demands for new businesses and industries will create diverse requirements and will therefore, lead to a newer architecture. Some other factors to categorize services can be as follows –

* Performance critical – very high peak data rates providing unlimited experience
* Capacity critical – to accommodate and manage huge number of concurrent connections
* Time critical – very low (<1 ms) radio latency
* Mobility critical – very high speed mobile systems (> 100 kmph)
* Cost critical – very low cost for massive deployment
* Energy critical – devices requiring large battery life (>10 years)
* Coverage critical – to cover large distances or deep in-building coverage

5G needs to support and unify all that have been added to 4G; like LTE Broadcast, device to device discovery, unlicensed spectrum, but also provide significant improvements over 4G. The continued 4G LTE evolution will take advantage of new spectrum opportunities below 6GHz that are becoming available before 2020. 5G will also take advantage of new spectrum opportunities that will become available beyond 2020, including 2G/3G re-farming and new spectrum above 6GHz like mm Wave. To support the expanded connectivity needs for the next decade, 5G should be much more than higher data rates and the addition of new spectrum.

To meet this vision, 5G needs the scalability across extreme variation of use cases; such as uniform fiber-like broadband everywhere—not just higher peak data rates, to new services like ultra-reliable mission critical applications to remotely control for example critical infrastructure or vehicles, and connect everything from simple battery powered sensors to complex robots. 5G needs to aim for a truly edgeless connectivity where devices are no longer just endpoints and a unified air interface for all spectrum and services. This will create unified platform designed for expanded connectivity in the next decade and beyond with improved cost and energy efficiency. So, 5G is not just a new generation, but a new kind of network, anticipated around 2020, that will transform the role of wireless.

The 5G technology should be scalable to extreme variation, so that today’s and tomorrow’s use cases can be serviced. The technology need to be supporting use cases such as:

* New form factors, wearables and massive proliferation of sensors and machine to machine type communication, or human to machine communication.
* Sensing what is around for new services and experiences, autonomous vehicles, with connectivity for example for collision avoidance.
* Smart homes/buildings/cities that require various connectivity needs, from high definition surveillance video to simply connecting parking meters.
* Control of critical infrastructure such as the electric grid, and industrial process automation
* Remote control of vehicles, such as cars, drones and other flying vehicles.
* Health services, emergency response and remote control of critical medical procedures where failure is not an option.
* Extreme mobile broadband both indoor and outdoor that no longer makes the distinction between fixed and wireless access meaningful.

5G is much more than higher peak rates and wider spectrum, it needs the scalability to address an extreme variation in use case and devices, that roughly spans the following service types:

* Massive number of connected things
* Enhanced mobile broadband
* Mission critical services, and
* Proximal and aware services

## Defining 5G Vision, Technology and Roadmap

India has traditionally been a consumer of technology, but played a larger role in developing and delivering services to the world. We should leverage on this fact and work towards building India as an empowered society, building and developing solutions for itself and the world to consume. Several policy instruments by the Government of India like Make in India, Digital India, etc. act as a vehicle to achieve this goal.

The mobile platform is already the biggest technology platform in history. Government of India has played a larger role helping in the proliferation of mobile broadband, and India leads the world with the mobile customers exceeding the fixed line customers. 5G could make this bigger to further transform societies and industries, with the right policy instruments in place.

## Technology & Standards Workroup

The 5GIF workgroup on technology and standards focuses on developing use cases and requirements tailored for Indian adoption. This includes integration concepts and migration paths, the evaluation of key technologies emerging from 5G standardization bodies like the 3GPP, and the 5G-ACIA.
