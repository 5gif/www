## Objective
This forum aims to become the leading force in the development of next generation communications and will enable synergizing national efforts and will play a significant role in shaping the strategic, commercial and regulatory development of the 3GPP 5G ecosystem in India.

The mobile platform is already the biggest technology platform in history, and has already overtaken PC and mobile computing is expanding beyond the smartphone applications. 5G could make it bigger to further transform societies and industries. This technology evolution is expected to enable new services, connect new industries and devices, and empower new user experiences, to support expanded connectivity needs for the next decade and beyond. It is envisioned that a national program built around the evolution of this technology will help India address the digital divide in a timeline that meets the aspirations of the government.

Adoption of 5G will require substantial investment in more downstream innovation than previous generations of communications systems. New business ecosystems are expected to emerge in which a multiplicity of players will meet, compete and work together. This will open opportunities to start-ups and smaller ecosystem players, which will eventually profit from the innovation capabilities offered by networks providing open interfaces to develop network "apps" and services.

5G India Forum will serve as a strategic national initiative which concerns all stakeholders, private and public, small and large, to meet the challenge of making 5G a reality in India, at timelines aligning with the rest of world.

5G India Forum is a collaborative body under the aegis of COAI.
